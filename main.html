            <h2>Why Social Media Impacts Mental Health</h2>
            <p>
                Social media platforms have become integral to our daily lives, offering numerous benefits like staying connected with friends and family, discovering new content, and sharing personal experiences. However, excessive use and dependence on these platforms can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Understanding these effects is crucial for developing a balanced approach to social media usage.
